How to build for Linux
======================

First you need to configure:

$ ./configure

If any dependencies are missing the configure script will complain or attempt
to disable optional features.

$ make

Build the binary, after build the binary resides in 'build.linux/'.
Thus, to start it, just type:

$ ./build.linux/tvheadend

Settings are stored in $HOME/.hts/tvheadend

How to build for FreeBSD
========================

First you need to configure tvheadend without epoll. Note that this
option also disables IPTV inputs.

$ ./configure --disable-epoll

To build tvheadend you should use gmake, instead of make.

$ gmake

The built binary is now in 'build.linux/'. Check that you have your drivers
installed and that webcamd daemon is running, if required. No further setup
should be needed.
