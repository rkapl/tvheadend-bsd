 <p>
 This tabs allow configuration of several general parameters that affect the
 core TVH functionality.
 </p>

 <dl>
  <dt>Default Language(s)
  <dd>
  Select the list of languages (in order of priority) to be used for supplying
  EPG information to clients that don't provide their own configuration.
  <p>
  The EPG information is NOT translated, this only applies to EPG providers
  that give information (titles, descriptions, etc..) in multiple languages.

  <dt>DVB scan files path:
  <dd>
  Select the path to use for DVB scan configuration files. Typically
  dvb-apps stores these in /usr/share/dvb/. Leave blank to use TVH's internal
  file set.
 </dl>

 <p>
 Icon caching - this will cache any channel icons or other images (such as
 EPG metadata). These will then be served from the local webserver, this
 can be useful for multi-client systems and generally to reduce hits on
 upstream providers.
 </p>

 <dl>

  <dt>Enabled
  <dd>
  Select whether or not to enable caching. Note: even with this disabled
  you can still specify local (file://) icons and these will be served by
  the built-in webserver.
  
  <dt>Re-fetch period (hours)
  <dd>
  How frequently the upstream provider is checked for changes.
  
  <dt>Re-try period (hours)
  <dd>
  How frequently it will re-try fetching an image that has failed to be
  fetched.
 </dl>
